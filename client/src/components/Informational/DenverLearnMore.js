            Denver recycles and composts only 20% of its waste, far behind the national average of
            34%. Curbside recycling is available only to most single-family residents--not to
            multi-family properties or businesses--and only 6% of Denver residents have composting
            collection. Multi-family and businesses are said to recycle and compost 22% of their
            waste- still a lot of room for improvement!
          </p>

          <p>
            Denver is falling behind on the basics of recycling at a time when major cities,
            including San Francisco, New York and Los Angeles, have set Zero Waste goals. Even
            Denver's peer cities, such as Salt Lake City, UT; Charlotte, NC; and Austin, TX, recycle
            twice as much as Denver. See how Denver compares on recycling to its peers.

            It's time to speak up and make better recycling and composting a priority for Denver!

              <p>
                Recycling is known as the Climate Solution's best ket secret. Recycling is not about
                the materials kept in the economy, it's about the energy saved in making all of your
                things.
              </p>
              <ul className="info-list">
                <p>Energy Savings in:</p>
                <li>Mining Natural Resources</li>
                <li>Transportation</li>

              </ul>
              <p>
                When you recycle, you give a material a second life. Plastic bottles can become new
                things like carpet or clothing; aluminum cans and other metals are easily melted and
                made into new products.
              </p>
              <p>Don't "feed the 'fill". Recycle and compost instead.</p>

              <p>"Most of my recycling goes to the landfill"</p>
              <p>
                Heavily contaminated loads do sometimes make it to the landfill. Recycling is a
                commodity, a clean product needs to be sorted at the Materials Recovery Facility
                (MRF) and is then sent to different markets worldwide.
              </p>
              <p>
                When a load is "too contaminated", it's barely distinguishable from your trash
                dumpster! There are organic materials, plastic bags, paper towels, appliances and
                even electronics! Most property managers are reluctant to provide recycling services
                for fear of contamination. When a bin is too contaminated, the property has the
                option of 1. cleaning out the recycling bin or 2. getting charged extra to haul the
                recyclables away as trash.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>"Landfills are ok, they recover energy"</p>
              <p>
                While modern landfills are incorporating "waste to energy" methane capture, over a
                landfill's lifespan, only 20% of the methane gas is adequately captured. The rest
                goes up to the atmosphere. Methane is 80x stronger than CO2!
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>"All plastic is recyclable"</p>
              <p>
                Remember how we mentioned plastic bags are considered contamination? All of your
                recyclables go to a big machine which separates materials. Aluminum with aluminum,
                glass with glass, paper with paper, cardboard with cardboard and so on. Plastic bags
                are very lightweight, they can actually get stuck in between the machine's gear and
                clog it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Make sure your neighbors DON'T add "tanglers" like headphones or christmas lights.

                  Some cities have municipally run systems like Denver, others have open markets
                  like Boulder, others have a single hauler like Golden and Commerce City.
