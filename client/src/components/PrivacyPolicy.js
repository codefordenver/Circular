          Privacy Policy Eco-Cycle aims to be as responsible when it comes to your privacy rights as
          we are when it comes to the environment. To this end, Eco-Cycle will not trade, rent, or
          sell any piece of member information to any individual or organization. Eco-Cycle is the
          sole owner of the information collected on this site. This information will not be sold or
          rented to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. User
          Information Eco-Cycle collects basic user information to help maintain and enhance our
          website, information such as the userâ€™s web browser, visit history, country of origin, and
          operating system. Any personal information you choose to provide is done so voluntarily.
          This information is used to provide services you request. You may unsubscribe at any time
          from any and all services through the subscription management page. Financial Transactions
          Eco-Cycle employs certified service providers to securely process charitable
          contributions, product purchases, or other financial exchanges. Personal information is
          kept private and secure and is not sold, rented, or traded to third parties. Credit card
          numbers are used only at the time of the transaction, and are not stored following the
          conclusion of the transaction unless a transaction is selected that occurs on a regular
          basis. For transactions that recur, credit card information is stored in an encrypted
          format. Links to external sites Throughout our website, Eco-Cycle provides links to
          external sites. While we take some precautions in directing visitors to other sites,
          Eco-Cycle is not responsible for the privacy practices of any sites outside of
          www.ecocycle.org. Site visitors are encouraged to exercise caution when conducting
          transactions outside of www.ecocycle.org and to read the privacy statements of each and
          every website that collects personally identifiable information. Use of material Eco-Cycle
          strongly believes in the importance of environmental education. Eco-Cycle encourages
          members to forward newsletters, donation requests, action alerts, and other communications
          to other interested parties to help raise environmental awareness. However, the reprinting
          or reuse of any text-based or graphic material from our website, publications, or other
          communications is strictly prohibited without express written consent from Eco-Cycle
          staff. Please contact Eco-Cycle for more information. Policy changes We reserve the right
          to modify this privacy policy at any time by posting a new policy to this site.
